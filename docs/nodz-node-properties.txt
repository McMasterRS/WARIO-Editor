Additional Nodz node properties:

-inputs/types -> sockets
-outputs/types -> plugs
-parameters -> local variables/constants for code
-code/template -> pointer/path to code snippet that is a consecution node

*Routing/GroupByNode needs to be examined for data/diagram timing of multiple plug/socket values

Custom Nodz nodes...
There should be three types of custom nodes available:

-Input -> provides a data source to nodz diagram
-Ouput -> deals with resulting data of a nodz diagram
-General -> processes data from sockets and produces results to a plug

Need to be able to add/delete/modify plug/socket names and types
Need to have an editor (with load/save functionality) and provide a consecution type template
Node plug/socket names/types should be available as a self.<variable> to the custom node code.
e.g: A socket called "ValueA" and type "float" should be available to the custom node code as self.ValueA

todo: - decide on how to deal with spaces in plug/socket names?
